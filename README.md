- A simple tool to check if a video file corrupted by calculate PSNR/SSIM with another reference video file.

## Directions

--------------------

- You must have .NET Framework 4.8 available from Windows Update.

- FFmpeg is now the default processor with both PSNR/SSIM, you can get ffmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/).

- VapourSynth script version has ability to handle defferent resolution video file and yeild more correct result, you can even write you own template script for even more complex condition.

- You shall install [VapourSynth R29](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/releases) or higher with [mvsfunc](https://github.com/HomeOfVapourSynthEvolution/mvsfunc/releases) and [python 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher to enable this processor.
